If you do not support macOS then you can stop reading.

What is happening?
Midway authentication was added to the Jamf admin console for Mac management. 
https://casperadmin.aka.amazon.com:8443

Why is this happening?
To satisfy a security requirement.

How does this affect me?
Midway authentication will be required before accessing the console if the web browser does not already have an active Midway session. 

Things to note:
There is no change in who is able to access the Jamf console. 
This does not affect the enrollment portal or Self Service.
This does not replace the Jamf admin console authentication. It is only a gate in front of it. You will still need to log into the Jamf console with your -admin account.

If you experience a problem with the Midway portal in front of the Jamf admin console, please make a comment on this SIM: https://sim.amazon.com/issues/P25771394

If you are already authenticated to Midway in your browser, you can test the link in a private/incognito window.
